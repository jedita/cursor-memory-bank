# CORE MEMORY BANK FILE LOCATIONS

**CRITICAL:** All core Memory Bank files reside within the current project directory resolved by `<MB_ROOT>`. The `<MB_ROOT>` macro dynamically resolves to the active project folder (e.g., `memory-bank/2024-06-10 12:30 -- VAN -- my-project/`). Do NOT create or modify these files outside the current project directory unless explicitly instructed for archiving purposes.

## Multi-Project Architecture

The Memory Bank now supports multiple isolated project contexts within a single repository. Each project has its own complete set of Memory Bank files in a dedicated sub-folder under `memory-bank/`.

**Project Folder Pattern**: `memory-bank/<timestamp> -- <stage> -- <project-name>/`

**Examples**:
- `memory-bank/2024-06-10 12:30 -- VAN -- my-feature/`
- `memory-bank/2024-06-09 15:45 -- IMPLEMENT -- user-auth/`

## Core File Locations (Project-Scoped)

* **Tasks File:** `<MB_ROOT>/tasks.md` - This file is used for active, in-progress task tracking, detailing steps, checklists, and component lists. Its content, particularly the detailed checklists, is merged into the main archive document for the task upon completion. After archival, `tasks.md` is cleared to be ready for the next task. It is an ephemeral working document during a task's lifecycle, with its persistent record captured in the task's archive file.
* **Active Context File:** `<MB_ROOT>/activeContext.md`
* **Progress File:** `<MB_ROOT>/progress.md`
* **Project Brief File:** `<MB_ROOT>/projectbrief.md`
* **Product Context File:** `<MB_ROOT>/productContext.md`
* **System Patterns File:** `<MB_ROOT>/systemPatterns.md`
* **Tech Context File:** `<MB_ROOT>/techContext.md`
* **Style Guide File:** `<MB_ROOT>/style-guide.md`
* **Creative Phase Docs:** `<MB_ROOT>/creative.md`
* **Reflection Docs:** `<MB_ROOT>/reflection.md`
* **Archive Directory:** `<MB_ROOT>/archive.md`

## Project Management Commands

* **LIST PROJECTS**: Display all available projects with timestamps and stages
* **SWITCH PROJECT <name>**: Switch to a different project context
* **CURRENT PROJECT**: Show the currently active project
* **NEW PROJECT <name>**: Create a new project with initial file set

## Macro Resolution

The `<MB_ROOT>` macro is resolved by the platform-awareness system:

1. **Discovery**: Scan `memory-bank/` for project folders matching the naming pattern
2. **Selection**: Choose project with latest timestamp as current (unless explicitly switched)
3. **Resolution**: Return absolute path to current project folder

**Verification Mandate:** Before any `create_file` or `edit_file` operation on these core files, verify the path starts with `<MB_ROOT>/`. The macro will be resolved to the appropriate project folder at runtime. If attempting to create a new core file (e.g., `tasks.md` at the start of a project), ensure it is created at `<MB_ROOT>/tasks.md`.
